# CryptoApp

In this app, 
I have used MVVM for app architecture.
The app has single Activity architecture with multiple fragments. 
For Background processing, I have used Kotlin coroutines.
I have consumed APIs provided by coinlayer.
Navigation Component has been used for Navigation between fragments. 
I have tried to write unit tests only for view models.
I have created a minimilist design as the time was short and 
schedule was very tough but i can create best designs. :).
